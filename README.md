# 🐾 PhantomClaw

> Your personal AI trading assistant that thinks, trades, and learns — all on autopilot.

PhantomClaw is an autonomous trading bot that connects to **MetaTrader 5** and uses AI to analyze markets and place trades for you. It supports **multiple LLM providers** (Claude, GPT-4o, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible API) with automatic failover. It runs 24/7 on your Windows VPS, communicates with you through **Telegram**, and gets smarter after every trade.

**Private use only.**

## 🧠 What It Does

1. **Reads the market** — Your MT5 Expert Advisor sends live price data to PhantomClaw every minute
2. **Thinks with AI** — The bot asks your LLM to analyze the data, check past lessons, news, and sentiment
3. **Remembers context** — Conversation history prevents contradictory decisions within the same day
4. **Decides to trade or wait** — A confidence score (0-100) determines if the setup is strong enough
5. **Uses tools** — Can search the web for news, check prices, and schedule its own rechecks
6. **Places pending orders** — If confidence is high enough, it places a limit/stop order in MT5
7. **Learns from results** — After every trade closes, the AI writes a lesson and updates its strategy
8. **Tells you what's happening** — You get Telegram alerts for trade decisions, session changes, and health pings

## 📦 What You Need

Before setting up PhantomClaw, make sure you have:

| Item | Where to Get It |
|------|----------------|
| **Windows VPS** (or PC that's always on) | Any VPS provider — yours is already set up |
| **MetaTrader 5** installed on the VPS | Your broker provides this |
| **Go 1.21+** installed | [Download Go](https://go.dev/dl/) |
| **GCC compiler** (for SQLite) | Install [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) — pick the 64-bit version |
| **Telegram Bot token** | Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram |
| **Your Telegram Chat ID** | Talk to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram |
| **AI API key** (at least one) | Get from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Groq](https://console.groq.com/), or any OpenAI-compatible provider |

---

## 🚀 Setup Guide

### Step 1: Download the code

Open PowerShell on your VPS and run:

```powershell
cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/nzkbuild/PhantomClaw.git
cd PhantomClaw
```

### Step 2: Set your API keys

Set these environment variables in PowerShell. Replace the values with your actual keys:

```powershell
# Required — at least one AI provider (set in config.yaml providers list)
$env:PHANTOM_LLM_PROVIDERS_0_API_KEY = "sk-ant-your-key-here"

# Optional — add more providers for fallback
$env:PHANTOM_LLM_PROVIDERS_1_API_KEY = "sk-your-openai-key"
$env:PHANTOM_LLM_PROVIDERS_2_API_KEY = "sk-your-groq-key"

# Required — Telegram
$env:PHANTOM_TELEGRAM_TOKEN = "123456:ABC-your-bot-token"
$env:PHANTOM_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "your-chat-id-number"
```

> 💡 The provider order in `config.yaml` determines priority. The first provider with a valid API key becomes primary. If it fails, the bot automatically falls back to the next one.

> 💡 **To make these permanent** (survive restarts), add them to System Environment Variables:
> Settings → System → About → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables → New

### Step 3: Edit config.yaml (optional)

The default settings are safe to start with. But if you want to adjust risk limits:

```yaml
risk:
  max_lot_size: 0.10       # Biggest trade size (start small!)
  max_daily_loss_usd: 100  # Stop trading if daily losses hit $100
  max_open_positions: 3    # Max 3 trades open at once
```

### Step 4: Build the bot

```powershell
cd C:\PhantomClaw
go build -o phantomclaw.exe ./cmd/phantomclaw/
```

If you see `CGO_ENABLED` errors, make sure TDM-GCC is installed and in your PATH.

### Step 5: Install the MT5 Expert Advisor

1. Copy `ea/PhantomClaw.mq5` to your MT5 `Experts` folder:
   ```
   C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\YOUR_TERMINAL_ID\MQL5\Experts\
   ```
2. Open MT5 → Navigator → Expert Advisors → right-click → Refresh
3. Drag `PhantomClaw` onto your XAUUSD H1 chart
4. **Important:** Go to Tools → Options → Expert Advisors → ✅ Allow WebRequest for listed URLs → Add `http://127.0.0.1:8765`

### Step 6: Run it!

```powershell
cd C:\PhantomClaw
.\phantomclaw.exe
```

You should see:
```
🐾 PhantomClaw v2.0.0 starting...
config loaded (mode=AUTO, tz=Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, pairs=[XAUUSD EURUSD USDJPY GBPUSD])
memory: SQLite initialized
sessions: store ready (dir=data/sessions)
heartbeat: started (every 5 min)
agent: brain initialized with full integrations + conversation memory
🐾 PhantomClaw is running
```

Open Telegram and send `/status` to your bot — it should reply!

## 🎮 Controlling the Bot

Everything is controlled through **Telegram**. Just send these commands to your bot:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Shows current mode, open positions, daily P&L, and session |
| `/halt` | 🛑 **Emergency stop** — freezes all trading immediately |
| `/mode auto` | Resume autonomous trading |
| `/mode observe` | Bot watches the market but doesn't trade |
| `/report` | Shows today's trade diary |
| `/pairs` | Shows active pairs and their win rates |
| `/confidence` | Shows the current confidence score |
| `/rollback` | Shows strategy versions (undo strategy changes) |
| `/config` | Shows your risk settings |
| `/help` | Shows all commands |

### Most Important Commands

- **Something going wrong?** → Send `/halt` immediately
- **Want to check what it's doing?** → Send `/status`
- **Want to resume after a halt?** → Send `/mode auto`

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
                    You (Telegram)
                         ↕
   MT5 EA ──signals──→ PhantomClaw Bot ──orders──→ MT5 EA
                         ↕
                    AI (Claude/GPT-4o)
                         ↕
                   Memory (SQLite DB)
                   - Trade history
                   - Lessons learned
                   - Strategy document
                   - Daily diary
```

**The loop:**
1. EA sends candle data + indicators every 60 seconds
2. Bot builds a prompt with: market data + strategy doc + past lessons + news + sentiment + **today's conversation history**
3. AI analyzes and can **use tools** (search web, check prices, schedule rechecks)
4. AI returns: HOLD or PLACE_PENDING (with price, SL, TP)
5. Bot checks: confidence score → correlation guard → spread filter → risk limits
6. If all checks pass → sends order back to EA
7. EA places the pending order in MT5
8. When order fills and closes → EA reports result → AI writes a lesson

### 🔧 Agent Tools

The AI agent has access to these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_price` | Current bid/ask/spread from MT5 |
| `place_pending` | Place limit/stop orders via EA bridge |
| `cancel_pending` | Cancel orders by ticket |
| `get_account_info` | Balance, equity, open positions |
| `cron_add` | Schedule future rechecks ("wake me in 30 min") |
| `web_search` | Search the web for market news |
| `web_fetch` | Read news articles and economic calendars |

## 🕐 Trading Sessions

PhantomClaw follows a daily schedule (all times in MYT / UTC+8):

| Time | Mode | What Happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| 00:00 – 08:00 | 🌙 LEARNING | Reviews past trades, rebuilds strategy, no trading |
| 08:00 – 15:00 | 📊 RESEARCH | Collects data, analyzes pairs, prepares orders |
| 15:00 – 00:00 | 💰 TRADING | Active trading via pending orders (London + NY sessions) |

**Key alerts you'll receive:**
- ☀️ 08:00 — Morning brief
- 📊 08:30 — Morning scan (all pairs)
- ⚡ 14:45 — "15 minutes to London open"
- 🇬🇧 15:00 — Trading mode activated
- 🔄 Every 30 min (trading) — Position check
- 💓 Every 5 min — Heartbeat health check

## 🛡️ Safety Features

PhantomClaw has multiple layers of protection — **the AI cannot override these:**

| Protection | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Max daily loss** | Stops trading if losses exceed $100/day (configurable) |
| **Max lot size** | Can never place a trade larger than 0.10 lots (configurable) |
| **Max open positions** | Can never have more than 3 trades open at once |
| **Drawdown circuit breaker** | Auto-HALT if account drops 10% from peak |
| **Minimum trade interval** | Must wait 15 minutes between trades |
| **Confidence gate** | Score below 40 = trade is blocked, no exceptions |
| **Correlation guard** | Blocks conflicting trades (e.g., buy EUR/USD + sell GBP/USD) |
| **Spread filter** | Blocks trades when spread is unusually wide (>2x average) |
| **Ramp-up system** | Starts with 50% lot size until 10 profitable trades prove consistency |
| **Weekend detection** | No trading on weekends |
| **Session enforcement** | OBSERVE mode forced outside trading hours |
| **`/halt` command** | You can freeze everything instantly from Telegram |

---

## 🔧 Configuration

All settings are in `config.yaml`. You can also override any setting with environment variables using the `PHANTOM_` prefix.

**Examples:**
```powershell
# Override config values without editing the file
$env:PHANTOM_BOT_MODE = "OBSERVE"
$env:PHANTOM_RISK_MAX_LOT_SIZE = "0.05"
$env:PHANTOM_RISK_MAX_DAILY_LOSS_USD = "50"
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "agent brain not configured"
→ You haven't set any AI API key. Set `PHANTOM_LLM_CLAUDE_API_KEY` (or another provider).

### MT5 EA shows "WebRequest error 4014"
→ You need to allow the URL in MT5: Tools → Options → Expert Advisors → Allow WebRequest → Add `http://127.0.0.1:8765`

### Bot doesn't respond on Telegram
→ Check your `PHANTOM_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` and `PHANTOM_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are correct. Send `/start` to your bot first.

### "CGO_ENABLED" build error
→ Install [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) (64-bit). This is needed for the SQLite database.

### Bot stops when I close PowerShell
→ Run it as a background service. Quick method:
```powershell
Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden .\phantomclaw.exe
```

### How do I check if it's running?
→ Send `/status` on Telegram. If you get a reply, it's alive.

### How do I stop it?
→ Send `/halt` on Telegram (freezes trading) or press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal (stops the bot).
